Walmart E‚ÄëCommerce Sales Analysis

üöÄ Project Overview:

This project analyzes Walmart e‚Äëcommerce sales data to uncover trends, identify top-performing stores and products, and explore the impact of external factors like holidays, fuel prices, and economic indicators. Insights from this work can help drive data-informed decisions for inventory, marketing, and revenue optimization  .

üìÅ Data Description

Source: Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting dataset (2010‚Äì2013)

Stores: 45 Walmart stores across diverse regions

Key Features:

Weekly_Sales, Holiday_Flag

External factors: Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, Unemployment

Store ID, Date, Department (if available)  

---

üß≠ Project Motivation & Objectives

Explore sales trends over time and across stores

Identify seasonal patterns and seasonal impacts on revenue

Measure how external economic factors correlate with sales

Compute key statistics to deepen business insights

Forecast future demand for better planning and strategy  

---

üõ† Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for preprocessing and visualization

Optional use of SQL (e.g., groupings, aggregations, joins)

Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for development

(Optional) Tableau / Power BI for dashboard-style visualizations

üìã Project Workflow

1. Data Collection & Loading

Import CSV dataset using Pandas



2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Handle missing values, duplicate rows

Convert date types and extract features (e.g., month, day, holiday flag)



3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*

Summary statistics: mean, min, max, variance, mode

Store-wise and time-wise sales grouping

Correlation analysis with external variables



4. Visualization

Heatmap for correlation matrix

Boxplots for weekly sales distribution

Bar charts for average sales per store or product category



5. Insights & Recommendations

Highlight best-performing stores and sales spikes

Show links between sales and external factors

Provide actionable suggestions for inventory and marketing



6. *(Optional) Forecasting Model*

Use regression or time-series modeling (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM)

Evaluate model using MSE or R¬≤ metrics for demand prediction accuracy  

---

üìä Key Insights

Certain external economic variables (like fuel price or CPI) show moderate correlation with sales  

Clear seasonal trends and holiday-related spikes appear in specific weeks or months

A few stores consistently outperform others in average weekly revenue

Predictive models like Random Forest provide strong accuracy for forecasting demand *(R¬≤ ~ 0.97)*
